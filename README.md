# VirusTotalHashChecker
Check files for malware, by calculating the [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) and check it on VirusTotal.
After intallation, you'll have item in context menu.  
However you can check files without installation,  
by dragging and dropping your files onto program exe file or onto program window.
